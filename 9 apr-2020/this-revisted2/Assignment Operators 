An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The first operand must be a variable and basic assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, a = b assigns the value of b to a.

 In addition to the regular assignment operator "=" the other assignment operators are shorthand for standard operations, as shown in the following table.

Shorthand	Expression	Description
a +=b	a = a + b	Adds 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first.
a -= b	a = a - b	Subtracts 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first.
a *= b	a = a*b	Multiplies 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first.
a /=b	a = a/b	Divides 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first.
a %= b	a = a%b	Computes the modulus of 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first.
a<<=b	a = a<<b	Performs a left shift and assigns the result to the first operand.
a>>=b	a = a>>b	Performs a sign-propagating right shift and assigns the result to the first operand.
a>>>=b	a = a>>>b	Performs a zero-fill right shift and assigns the result to the first operand.
a&= b	a = a&b	Performs a bitwise AND and assigns the result to the first operand.
a^= b	a = a^b	Performs a bitwise XOR and assigns the result to the first operand.
a |=b	a = a|b	Performs a bitwise OR and assigns the result to the first operand.
