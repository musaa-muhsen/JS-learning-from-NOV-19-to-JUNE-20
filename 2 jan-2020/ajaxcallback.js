// give me this information formatterd in this way and I'll give you this data this function or whatever that reponse may be.  
// so the chuck norris project is a perfect example of a web API takes a request which was the URL all along with the number of jokes that we wanted and it processed that and then it sent back a reponse formatted as JSON with the chuck norri jokes

// rest was made to treat objects on the server side as resources that can be created, updated, detroyed and deleted. a example of a server side object would be a blog post in a database we can create these posts with post request, delete with a delete request  
// what makes rest good is that it operates using just HTTP and JSON

//API is the messenger, and then rest lets us use HTTP requests to format that message. 
//rest API takes in multiple types of HTTP requests
