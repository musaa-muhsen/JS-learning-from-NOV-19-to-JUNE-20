// EVENT PROPAGATION PATH 

capture down, bubble up.

- TARGET PHASE DEFINATION

Once the event reaches the destination it finally gets to fire on the target element, 
just in case the target itself has an event handler registered to it. 

To review, event propagation can be broken into three phases.

1) The capture phase — event object starts at Window and moves towards event target firing on every element in its path.
2) The target phase —event fires only once on the target element.
3) The bubble phase — event fires on the parent of the target and keeps firing all the way back to Window.
