// so we know that inside of dog we want to call the animal constructor function

// so what that means is thagt we want to call animal but with "this" keyword from dog 
// so when the animal function runs, we want this to reference the dog instance and not 
// the animal.

// need to use the function excution for content more 

// this as this context to be used when invoked
