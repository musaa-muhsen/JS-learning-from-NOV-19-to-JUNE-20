// export {myNameIs,myAgeIs}
// rename export 
//export { User as Bitch }

// in JavaScript you need to make sure when for linking files paths that you put at the start a dot slash if you're wanting to use relative paths ./ or just a single slash / if you want to use a an absolute path 

// this is what we are trying to achieve 
// const person1 = new User('tom', 25);
// console.log(person1)
// myNameIs(person1)
// myAgeIs(person1)

/*
function sayHi(user) {
    alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
  }

  function sayBye(user) {
    alert(`Bye, ${user}!`);
  }

  export {sayHi, sayBye}; // a list of exported variables
  â€¦Or, technically we could put export above functions as well.
