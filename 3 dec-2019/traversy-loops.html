      //FOR IN LOOP
      //for in loops are basically loop or iterate through objects so we can get key value pairs. 
      //for/in - loops through the properties of an object

      //syntax is = 
      //for (variable in object)
      //statement

     //objects have key value pairs
    
   //Specifically, "enumerable" means that there is some sort of ordering scheme taking place, so that you can quickly/easily address the items in that set/sequence/collection (or, in that section of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, the object).

      const obj = {a: 1,
                   b: 2,
                   c: 3};
        
    
      for (const prop in obj) {
          //console.log(prop);
         let outcome = `${prop}: ${obj[prop]}`;
         console.log(outcome);
      }




        //The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.
        var y = 10;
        //y += 5;
        //same as 
         y = y + 5;
         console.log(y);
        
    //parameters and arguments explained 

    //Function Parameters
/* 

Parameters identify values that are passed into a function. 
For example, a function to add three numbers might have three parameters. 
A function has a name, and it can be called from other points of a program. 
When that happens, the information passed is called an argument.
 Modern programming languages typically allow functions to have several parameters.

Each function parameter has a type followed by an identifier, 
and each parameter is separated from the next parameter by a comma. 
The parameters pass arguments to the function. When a program calls a function, 
all the parameters are variables. The value of each of the resulting arguments 
is copied into its matching parameter in a process call pass by value. 
The program uses parameters and returned values to create functions 
that take data as input, make a calculation with it and return the value to the caller.

The Difference Between Functions and Arguments
The terms parameter and argument are sometimes used interchangeably.
 However, parameter refers to the type and identifier, and arguments are the values passed to the function.
In the following C++ example, int a and int b are parameters,
 while 5 and 3 are the arguments passed to the function.

int addition (int a, int b)
{
  int r;
  r=a+b;
  return r;
}
