why the this keyword exists in the first place? The this keyword allows you to reuse 
functions with different contexts. Said differently, the “this” keyword allows you 
to decide which object should be focal when invoking a function or a method. 
Everything we talk about after this will build upon that idea. We want to be able to 
reuse functions or methods in different contexts or with different objects.

var person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
person.fullName();   // Will return "John Doe"



The this Keyword

In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
