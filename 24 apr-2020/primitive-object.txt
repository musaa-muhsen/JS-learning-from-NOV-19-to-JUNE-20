Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!
When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:

var x = new String();        // Declares x as a String object
var y = new Number();        // Declares y as a Number object
var z = new Boolean();       // Declares z as a Boolean object
Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.

var flag = new Boolean(false); //but this is an object
same as 
var flag = false; 


var obj1 = new Object();
obj1.Name = 'person';
obj1.TellNo = '1989127278'

var sample = new Array();
sample[0] = obj1;
sample[1] = new Object();

console.log(sample)
