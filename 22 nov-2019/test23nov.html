// an anonymous function (a function without a name).
//Functions stored in variables do not need function names.
// They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.

//functions that are sent into other functions are called CALL BACK functions,
//...because the hoist function will call back to them
      
//"filter" will loop through each item in the array, and for each item it will pass into the call back function
