why the this keyword exists in the first place. 
The this keyword allows you to reuse functions with 
different contexts. Said differently, the “this” keyword 
allows you to decide which object should be focal when 
invoking a function or a method. Everything we talk about 
after this will build upon that idea. We want to be able 
to reuse functions or methods in different contexts or with 
different objects.
