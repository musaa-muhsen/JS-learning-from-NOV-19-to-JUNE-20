The HTMLCollection interface represents a generic collection (array-like object similar to arguments)
of elements (in document order) and offers methods and properties for selecting from the list.

// DOM node lists 
// so depending on what method you use for example if you use the getElementsByTagName() method returns as 
HTMLCollection object but if you use for example querySelectorAll it returns a node list object. 


// both HTMLCollection and node list can be looped over // brad is wrong???
