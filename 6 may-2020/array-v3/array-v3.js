//The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.
//Tip: If an empty string ("") is used as the separator, the string is split between each character.
//Note: The split() method does not change the original string.
// spliting the string as in spliting hairs or primitives

// .slice 
// slice of pie 
/*
Allows you to create a new array from a portion of an existing array. It also doesnâ€™t modify the original array.
.slice takes two arguments. The first argument is the index of the beginning item you want to grab in the array and the second argument is the index of the end item you want to grab in the array, not inclusive. So for example, if you do .slice(1,4), the array that is returned will have whatever elements were in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd index in the original array, not the 4th.
*/
// Zero-based index before which to end extraction. slice extracts up to but not including end. For example, slice(1,4) extracts the second element through the fourth element (elements indexed 1, 2, and 3).
const animals = ['ant', 'bison', 'camel', 'duck', 'elephant'];

// ==============================================================================================
// .some 
// Used to determine if ANY element in an array passes a test specified by a given function. The function passed to some gets invoked once for each element in the array. As soon as that function returns a truthy value, some will stop executing and return true. If the function passed to some never returns a truthy value, then some will return false.

// .sort
// Allows you to sort the elements of an array. This one is more complex than Iâ€™d like it to be. Hereâ€™s my rule of thumb that works _most of the time_â„¢. If what youâ€™re sorting is based on string values, you can call .sort() and youâ€™d get what youâ€™d expect.
// .sort() is good for strings 
// Note that .sort is mutative so each time you invoking it youâ€™re modifying the original array. // but you can make a new array out of it still 
// you can use it for the Date object as well 
// can be decended as well so swap b - a

    //a 21 - b 19 = 2 so B is first 19,21,35,38,18,23

// higher as in number and first as in the array index
console.log(55 - 96) // -41 // does 55 go higher than 96? false because 96 is higher and also -41 is returned so negative goes first 

// now what happens is when this function returns a negative value that means that a is going to be before b in the
// finalised sorted array, if you get a positive number sum of this sum callback function then it mean that 
// b will be above a in the sorted form so it depends on the return value of this compare function negative means that 
// a is first positive means that b is first and zero means that they're both the same so they're next to each other
